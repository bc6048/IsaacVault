_Nothing is warranted_, as no ciphers can be proven entirely hack-proof. 


Popularity isn't determinant of security. Many ciphers that was once “most trusted” were broken within 30 years after their punishments.

There's no reason to ditch the algorithms of many other less-known cryptographically secure ciphers that hasn't been proven to broken for more than 30 years.

Hence this laboratory doesn't stick to their golden rule of the so called _"Most Trusted”_.
