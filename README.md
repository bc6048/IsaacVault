Nothing is warranted, as no ciphers can be proven entirely hack-proof. 


Popularity isn't determinant of security. Many cipher that was once “most trusted” were broken within 30 years of their punishments.

Hence, there's no reason to ditch the algorithms of many other less-known cryptographically secure ciphers that hasn't been proven to broken for more than 30 years.
