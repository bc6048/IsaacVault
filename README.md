# The golden rule
Popularity isn't determinant of the security of the ciphers. Many ciphers that was once “most trusted” were broken within 30 years after their publishments.

There's no reason to ditch the algorithms of many other lesser-known cryptographically secure ciphers that hasn't been proven to be broken for more than 30 years. We're open to exploring new and potentially more secure options, instead of just sticking to the mainstream.

_Nothing is warranted_, as no ciphers can be proven entirely hack-proof. We can't just trust something and get complacent because it's well-known. We need to constantly improve and adapt.

For the reasons above, this laboratory doesn't stick to their golden rule of the so called "Most Trusted”.
